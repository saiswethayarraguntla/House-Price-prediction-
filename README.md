# House-Price-prediction-
Predicting House Price is quiet an interesting and popular project that people work on. The project I did will differentiate the conventional project by introducing the visual data into the dataset. The goal of the project is to build a novel automatic house price estimation system by using both textual and visual inputs, other than only using textual information such as area, neighborhood, and number of bedrooms. 


Problem Formulation  
 
Most existing automatic house price estimation systems rely only on some textual data like its neighborhood area and the number of rooms. In this project, we practice with algorithms to extract visual features from house photos and combining them with the houseâ€™s textual information.

Build your deep neural network model and print out its RMSE and lift chart on test data.
